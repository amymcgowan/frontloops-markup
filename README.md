# Frontloops Markup Challenge
[frontloops.io](https://frontloops.io/)


This repo holds my solutions to each html/css coding challenge offered by Frontloops.  I receive the challenges, one at a time, to my email.  The email includes relevant assests such as img files needed for the project as well as an img and/or video clip of what the end result should look like.  I then used the files to recreate the design.

An index of the projects can be found at [amymcgowan.dev/frontloops-markup/](https://amymcgowan.dev/frontloops-markup/).
